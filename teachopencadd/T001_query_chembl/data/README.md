# Data

This folder stores input and output data for the Jupyter notebook.

- `EGFR_compounds.csv`: final file obtained in this talktorial, reused in other talktorials in the 001-010 series
- `EGFR_compounds_CHEMBL27.csv.zip`: local dump of the large bioactivities query, meant as a plan B for unstable connections
- `all_chembl_activities.ipynb`: notebook used to generate file below
- `chembl27_activities.npz.zip`: all dataset indices as present in ChEMBL27, used to filter results down to a deterministic behaviour in our CI
