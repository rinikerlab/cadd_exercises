__Talktorial T002__: This talktorial is part of the TeachOpenCADD pipeline described in the [first TeachOpenCADD paper](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-019-0351-x), comprising of talktorials T001-T010.


## Aim of this talktorial

In the context of drug design, it is important to filter candidate molecules by e.g. their physicochemical properties. In this talktorial, the compounds acquired from ChEMBL (__Talktorial 001__) will be filtered by Lipinsik's rule of five to keep only orally bioavailable compounds.


### Contents in _Theory_

* ADME - absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
* Lead-likeness and Lipinski's rule of five (Ro5)
* Radar charts in the context of lead-likeness


### Contents in _Practical_

* Define and visualize example molecules
* Calculate and plot molecular properties for Ro5
* Investigate compliance with Ro5
* Apply Ro5 to the EGFR dataset
* Visualize Ro5 properties (radar plot)
