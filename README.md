# Getting started in your own python environment

1. Install a miniconda distribution, we recommend miniforge.
2. Make sure you have mamba installed in your base environment.
3. Create the cadd_exercises environment with the command: `mamba env create -f cadd_exercises.yml`
4. Activate the environment: `conda activate cadd_exercises`
